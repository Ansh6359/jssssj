Folder name: Assignment 1
File name: my-Portfolio

The website contains four pages: Home, About, Project, and Contact. All the files are created using Node.js, Express, and Handlebars (HBS) views.
All HBS files are located under the VIEWS folder.
All CSS files are located under the public/stylesheets folder.
I have used some images for the background and profile picture, which are located under the public/images folder.
Additionally, I designed the header, footer, and other fixed layout components in the layout.hbs and layout.css files.
My code runs on http://localhost:3000.
In the header, there are links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
